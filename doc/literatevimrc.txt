INTRODUCTION                                    *literatevimrc*

I have tons of comments in my ~/.vimrc file. I try to leave a lot of
comments because everything in my Vim configuration is hard-won
knowledge. My ~/.vimrc is accumulated knowledge from the day I first
opened the editor and couldn't figure out how to leave until now, many
years later, when I open my editor and don't have any reason to leave.
I have tweaked, cajoled, and tamed this beast called Vim. I think a lot
of folks have configuration kind of like that -- it's knowledge that is
locked-away, not privately or purposefully, just badly-documented and
ubiquitous. This is a problem.

So I made a thing.

It lets you keep your configuration as a Markdown file with the actual
configuration inside of codeblocks.

INSTALL                    *iteratevimrc-install* *literatevimrc-setup*

Install is fairly simple. You just move your current vim configuration
file to a different spot, format it as a markdown file, and source it
from your "real" vimrc file via:

    runtime! plugin/literatevimrc.vim

This can be the only content inside your vimrc -- it is in mine.
